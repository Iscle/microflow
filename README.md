## How to build

Clone this repository and then execute the following command in your terminal:

```
mvn clean install
```

This will create in the `target` folder three files:

1. Microflow-x.x.x.jar (cross-platform)
2. Microflow-x.x.x.exe (Windows)
3. Microflow-x-x.x.dmg (macOS)

Note: the DMG file will only be built when ran on macOS. On other operating systems, a .app will be built instead.
